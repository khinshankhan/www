Hello hello :wave: I'm Khinshan, feel free to call me Shan. I wear several hats but I'm mostly a software engineer
:upside_down_face: Though I have a knack for backend development, I tend to work fullstack as a jack of all
trades. Recently, I've been diving into the realm of accessibility and crafting captivating user experiences. Feel free
to explore [my work](/projects)! Or better yet, read some of my [thoughts and ideas](/writings).

While I might share similar thoughts with my colleagues from time to time, it should be clear that unless explicitly
stated, my writing and opinions **shouldn't be seen as representing my employer** in any way. Similarly, unless
explicitly stated otherwise, the opinions expressed by my employer **don't necessarily reflect my own**.

Some things I like that you may like:

- cooking
- linguistics
- puzzles & fallacies
- (video | board | \*)games
- interactivity
- unordered lists

### This Site

To start with, the source code for this website is available on [GitHub
here](https://github.com/khinshankhan/www). You're free to use the code per the licensing I have on it. The content,
however, is not under as free to use; I'm still working it out (TLDR: cite me if you use my words, would be cool if you
mentioned me somewhere when you use my code too :stuck_out_tongue:)

I’ve been discontent with my website; I must’ve changed it 10+ times now. After experimenting from vanilla to
[Harp](https://github.com/sintaxi/harp) to [Frozen Flask](https://github.com/Frozen-Flask/Frozen-Flask) to
[Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) and etcetera etcetera, I've realized what I should use is what I feel most
comfortable with and similar to what I use for work. Hopefully embracing modern technologies will make this full-on
rewrite the last rewrite for years on end. I've named it 'anchorage' to keep me anchored... hopefully :flushed:

I don't intend on making this a reusable template easy for anyone to use at the moment, but I _am_ trying to decouple
personal information from the components. It's a long process and gets harder as tech debt piles up, but maybe one day
this will be easy to fork and wind up.

### Kudos

This website is a reflection of the elements I'd like to see on the web and web elements I've seen. I've tried to add a
comment everywhere I used code from Stack Overflow or someone else, but the design is much harder to comment on it ends
up being more of a collection of inspirations all combined with my imagination. It's only fair to credit people who've
probably inspired aspects of my site here (in no particular order):
