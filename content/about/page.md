Hello, hello! :wave: I'm Khinshan, but feel free to call me Shan. I'm a software engineer with a
love for solving problems and creating delightful experiences -- whether it's crafting smooth
backends, diving into fullstack projects, or exploring accessibility and user-centered design. Think
of me as a curious tinkerer, always eager to learn and build.

If you're interested, check out [my projects](/projects) or take a peek at [my writings](/writings)
-- they're a mix of ramblings, explorations, and ideas I just couldn't keep to myself.

## Who I Am (or Try to Be)

Outside of tech, I'm drawn to all kinds of creative endeavors and intellectual rabbit holes. Here
are some things that might connect us:

- Experimenting in the kitchen (recipes are just guidelines, right?) :shallow_pan_of_food:
- Solving puzzles, falling for fallacies, and unraveling linguistic quirks :jigsaw:
- (Video | Board | \*)games :game_die:
- Exploring experiences and interactivity :sparkles:
- Unordered lists :wink:

I also believe in keeping things real: my thoughts here are my own and shouldn't be seen as
representing my employer, and vice versa. If you see me referencing work-related topics, know that I
try to be as clear and transparent as possible.

## About This Site

This little corner of the internet has been a work-in-progress (and obsession) for years. The site's
code is open-source ([GitHub](https://github.com/khinshankhan/www)) -- feel free to explore and use
it within the bounds of the license.

The content and design? That's personal. Draw inspiration, sure, but outright cloning? Let's not
flood the interwebs with 786 copies. A shoutout would be appreciated if you use anything from here
:slightly_smiling_face:

I've rebuilt this website more times than I should ever admit -- trying everything from
[Harp](https://github.com/sintaxi/harp) to [Frozen
Flask](https://github.com/Frozen-Flask/Frozen-Flask) to [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll)
and so on and so forth.

After many experiments, I've settled on a _set of principles_ that feels both familiar and
modern. This iteration is codenamed "Anchorage" -- a reminder to keep me grounded as I chase the
horizon.

information.

## Gratitude and Inspiration

This site is a reflection of the web I love -- a blend of elements I've admired and ones I wish
existed. Here are a few creators and communities who've shaped my ideas (in no particular order):

- [TwiN](https://twin.sh/)
- [Xetera](https://xetera.dev/)
- [Lekoarts](https://www.lekoarts.de/)
- [Lee Robinson](https://leerob.io/)
- [Josh W. Comeau](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/)
- [Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/)
- [The Programmer's Hangout](https://discord.gg/programming/) and
  [Next.js](https://discord.com/invite/nextjs) discord servers.

## Closing Note

This site evolves as I do -- think of it as my digital phoenix, reborn again and again (hopefully
fewer times now). If you have feedback, questions, snarky jokes, or want to say hi, don't hesitate
to [connect](/connect).

Thanks for visiting!

Cheers, the Person Behind the 0s and 1s :v:
