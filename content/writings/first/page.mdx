#### Formatting

Okay so now we try _italics_ and **bold** and _underline_ and **_something_**. Seems something corrects from `***something***` to `**_something_**`.

  be. I love donut souffl√© oat cake cake pastry marzipan I love. Cake bear claw bear claw
  marzipan gummies jujubes fruitcake. Cheesecake cookie marshmallow marshmallow macaroon
  tart pastry marshmallow.
- Oj
