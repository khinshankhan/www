Hello there. This is where experiments sprout and blossom. Some even become features! Or they may become bugs that then
become features. Or they... well yea, stuff happens.

Ctr-f `TODO` to quickly find things I'm working on implementation. Likely in order of top to bottom.

but also without any variant

and now a quote with a caption:

> [!QUOTE]
>
> The truth may be puzzling. It may take some work to grapple with. It may be counterintuitive.
> It may contradict deeply held prejudices. It may not be consonant with what we desperately
> want to be true. But our preferences do not determine what's true. We have a method, and that
> method helps us to reach not absolute truth, only asymptotic approaches to the truth â€” never
> there, just closer and closer, always finding vast new oceans of undiscovered possibilities.
> Cleverly designed experiments are the key.
