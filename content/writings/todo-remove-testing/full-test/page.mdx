### Le tests

#### Headings

Now then, headings:

#### Quatro

##### Cinco

###### Seis

#### Blockquotin'

> [!NOTE]
>
> This is a quote

> [!TIP] With a title
>
> This is a quote

> [!IMPORTANT] With a title
>
> This is a quote

> [!WARNING] With a title
>
> This is a quote

> [!CAUTION] With a title
>
> This is a quote

and this continues the paragraph.

> [!QUOTE]
>
> This is another quote that is long enough to be on multiple lines. Let's see how it looks. And just to make sure it's long enough, I'll add some more text. Just a bit more.

but also without any variant

> This is another quote that is long enough to be on multiple lines. Let's see how it looks. And just to make sure it's long enough, I'll add some more text. Just a bit more.

and now a quote with a caption:

> [!QUOTE]
>
> The truth may be puzzling. It may take some work to grapple with. It may be counterintuitive.
> It may contradict deeply held prejudices. It may not be consonant with what we desperately
> want to be true. But our preferences do not determine what's true. We have a method, and that
> method helps us to reach not absolute truth, only asymptotic approaches to the truth — never
> there, just closer and closer, always finding vast new oceans of undiscovered possibilities.
> Cleverly designed experiments are the key.

#### Formatting

Okay so now we try _italics_ and **bold** and _underline_ and **_something_**. Seems something corrects from `***something***` to `**_something_**`.

H_2_O

X^2

#### Links!

hello from [external link to google](https://google.com) and [internal link to home](/) and [external fake file from google](https://google.com/foo.pdf) and [internal fake file](/foo.pdf) hehe.

#### Lists

A short unordered list test (they may be wrong but think of it as lorem)

- Teas
  - Black tea
    1. Assam
    2. Darjeeling
    3. Earl Grey
    4. Oolong Tea

       3. Wuyi Rock Tea
  - Green Tea

- Testing a super long list item wrapping. This will be nonsense, as lorem ipsum tends to
  be. I love donut soufflé oat cake cake pastry marzipan I love. Cake bear claw bear claw
  marzipan gummies jujubes fruitcake. Cheesecake cookie marshmallow marshmallow macaroon
  tart pastry marshmallow.
- Oj

And now an ordered list which fails to loop :weary:

            1. lower alpha
