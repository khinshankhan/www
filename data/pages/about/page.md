Hello hello :wave: I'm Khinshan, feel free to call me Shan. I wear several hats but I'm mostly a software engineer :upside_down_face: Though I have a knack for backend development, I tend to work fullstack as a jack of all trades. Recently, I've been diving into the realm of accessibility and crafting captivating user experiences. Feel free to explore my [work](/projects)! Or better yet read some of my [thoughts and ideas](/writings).

I do want to make it clear that although at times my thoughts may be the same as my colleagues, unless stated explicitly, my writing and opinions _should_ not be considered _wholly nor partially representative_ of my employer. In that vein, unless stated explicitly... employers' opinions are not mine.

Some things I like that you may like:

- cooking
- linguistics
- puzzles & fallacies
- (video | board | \*)games
- interactivity
- unordered lists

## This Site

To start with, the source code for this website is available on [GitHub here](https://github.com/khinshankhan/anchorage). You're free to use the code in accordance to the MIT licensing I have on it. The content however is not under MIT licensing, I'm still working it out (tldr: cite me if you use my words, would be cool if you mentioned me somewhere when you use my code too :stuck_out_tongue:)

I’ve been discontent with my website, I must’ve changed it 10+ times now. After experimenting from vanilla to [Harp](https://github.com/sintaxi/harp) to [Frozen Flask](https://github.com/Frozen-Flask/Frozen-Flask) to [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) etcetera, I've realized what I should use is what I feel most comfortable with and similar to what I use for work. Hopefully embracing modern technologies will make this full on rewrite the last rewrite for years on end. I've named it anchorage to keep me anchored... hopefully :flushed:

I don't intend on making this a reusable template easy for anyone to use at the moment, but I _am_ trying decouple personal information from the components. It's a long process and gets harder as tech debt piles up, but maybe one day this will be easy to fork and wind up.

## Kudos

This site's a reflection of the elements I'd like to see on the web and elements I've seen. I've tried to add in a comment everywhere I used code from stackoverflow or someone else but design's much harder to comment since it ends up being more of a collection of inspirations all combined together with my imagination. It's only fair to credit people who've probably inspired aspects of my site here (in no particular order):

- [TwiN](https://twin.sh/)
- [Xetera](https://xetera.dev/)
- [Lekoarts](https://www.lekoarts.de/)
- [Lee Robinson](https://leerob.io/)
