Hello there. This showcases the components, styles, and other design ~~torture~~ fun I created and use across this
website. Some elements are 'wrongly styled' items due to the demo elements (they normally wouldn't be used like this on
an actual page), and other elements may be forcefully styled due to the MDX setup. Ergo, although this probably isn't
nicely formatted or anything, but should be interesting on one page. Feel free to take a gander!

### Typography

#### Headings

<h1>Heading h1</h1>
<h2>Heading h2</h2>
<h3>Heading h2</h3>
<h4>Heading h4</h4>
<h5>Heading h5</h5>
<h6>Heading h6</h6>

#### Other Typography

paragraph

This is <span className="main-nav">main nav</span>.

This is <span className="small">small</span>.

This is <span className="align-super">sup</span>.

This is <span className="align-sub">sub</span>.

### Lists

### Etc

This is a link [Google link](https://google.com) and it goes to google.

This is inline code `const add = (...args) => args.reduce((sum, n) => sum + n, 0)`

As opposed to a codeblock

```js
const add = (...args) => args.reduce((sum, n) => sum + n, 0)
```

### Currently Testing

Smiley face :) yay
